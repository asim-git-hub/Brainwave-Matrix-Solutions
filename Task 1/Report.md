# 📊 Flipkart Sales Data Analysis

## 🧩 Problem Statement
- E-commerce platforms list thousands of products with dynamic pricing and ratings.  
- The challenge lies in understanding trends in pricing, discounts, and customer feedback.  
- This project aims to analyze Flipkart’s mobile phone listings to derive actionable business insights.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Flipkart’s mobile phone dataset from Kaggle.  
- Use Python libraries to visualize pricing, brand performance, discount patterns, and customer satisfaction through product ratings.

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Kaggle Flipkart dataset  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing nulls, converting data types, formatting prices and ratings  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new fields like discount percentage  
4. **EDA**: Visualizations for ratings, prices, discounts, and brand performance  
5. **Insight Extraction**: Summarizing key findings

## 📐 Algorithm & Deployment

- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud  
- **Focus**: Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis  
- **ML Use**: None (Exploratory only)  
- **Deployment (Future Scope)**: Use Streamlit or Dash for interactive dashboards

---

## 📈 Results

- Top brands: Samsung, Apple, Motorola  
- Average discount: 15–25% (up to 80% for some)  
- Most ratings between 3.5 and 4.5 stars  
- Budget phones receive higher discounts

## 🧾 Conclusion

The analysis provides a solid understanding of Flipkart’s pricing strategy, customer preferences, and product positioning.  
It highlights brand dominance and discount patterns, which can inform marketing and pricing decisions.

## 🌱 Future Scope

- Apply machine learning to predict product performance  
- Build interactive dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, Streamlit)  
- Analyze user reviews using sentiment analysis  
- Extend to other product categories (laptops, fashion, etc.)  
- Perform time series forecasting for price trends
