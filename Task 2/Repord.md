# 📊 Social Media Sentiment Analysis – Airline Tweets

## 🧩 Problem Statement
- Social media platforms like Twitter host real-time public opinion about services, products, and events.  
- Airlines often face direct feedback on Twitter, which makes it a valuable source for sentiment analysis.  
- The challenge is to process unstructured tweet data and extract insights about customer sentiment.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Perform sentiment analysis on real-world Twitter data about major U.S. airlines.  
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify tweets into sentiments (positive, neutral, negative).  
- Visualize sentiment distribution, word patterns, and sentiment trends over time.

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Kaggle Airline Tweet Sentiment Dataset  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Text preprocessing (removing URLs, mentions, punctuation, etc.)  
3. **NLP Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
4. **EDA**: Visualizations of sentiment classes and word clouds  
5. **Modeling**: Logistic Regression using TF-IDF features  
6. **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix and classification report  
7. **Time Series (Optional)**: Sentiment trend analysis over time

## 📐 Algorithm & Deployment

- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, WordCloud, Scikit-learn  
- **ML Algorithm**: Logistic Regression  
- **Text Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)  
- **Deployment (Future Scope)**: Streamlit app for real-time tweet classification

---

## 📈 Results

- Majority of tweets were **negative**, indicating dissatisfaction with airline services.  
- **United Airlines** received the most negative feedback, followed by **American Airlines**.  
- The **Logistic Regression** model performed well, with high accuracy in detecting negative tweets.  
- **WordClouds** revealed frequent issues like delays, customer service, and cancellations.  
- **Time-series analysis** showed spikes in negative sentiment on specific dates—possibly linked to incidents or service failures.

## 🧾 Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates how Twitter can be leveraged to monitor public sentiment about airline services.  
It identifies key problem areas, peak dissatisfaction times, and brand-specific sentiment differences.  
This can inform customer service improvements, crisis response, and marketing strategies.

## 🌱 Future Scope

- Apply **deep learning** models like LSTM or BERT for better sentiment classification  
- Integrate **real-time Twitter API** to stream and classify tweets live  
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit or Dash  
- Expand to **other domains**: e-commerce reviews, political tweets, or entertainment  
- Perform **airline-wise comparative studies** over time
